- Business Text plugin `marcusolsson-dynamictext-panel` version `6.1.0`
- No datasource, backend service, CDN, images, or network access

Install the required panel plugin:

```bash
grafana cli plugins install marcusolsson-dynamictext-panel 6.1.0
```

## Import

In Grafana, select **Dashboards ? New ? Import dashboard**, then upload `grafana-alert-whack-a-mole.json`. No datasource mapping is needed.

## Controls
